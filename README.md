# DJS C Programming Lab Questions

This repo contains answers for the C Programming Lab Experiments.

1. To calculate simple interest taking principal, rate of interest and number of years as input from user.
2. Write a program to find greatest of three numbers using conditional operator.
3. Write a program to check if the year entered is leap year or not.
4. Write a program to calculate roots of a quadratic equation
5. Write a menu driven program to perform add / subtract / multiply / divide based on the users choice. The
user will indicate the operation to be performed using the signs i.e. + for addition, - for subtraction and so
on.
6. Write a program to find the sum of seven terms using a for loop for the following series: 1/1!+2/2!+3/3!+………..+7/7!
7. Write a program to read a number, reverse the number and display the sum of digits of number.
8. Write a program (using 'for' loop) to display the following asking the user for the number of lines.
<pre>
<br/>

ABCDEDCBA 
</pre>
9. Write a program to check if the entered number is Armstrong or not.
10. Write a program to display first n elements of Fibonacci series (using 'for')
11. Write a program to find nCr using function.
12. Write a program which will accept n and r and calculate nCr=n!/r!(n-r)! using recursive functions.
13. Write a program to initialize an automatic and static variable and increment it in the function. Call this 
function thrice and print the value of the variable every time after incrementing.
14. Write a program to implement bubble sorting algorithm for sorting numbers in ascending order.
15. Write a program to check whether string is palindrome or not.
16. Write a program to count blank spaces, digits, vowels and consonants in the string.
17. Write a program to multiply two matrices using a function.
18. Define a structure called cricket that will describe the following information –player name, country 
name best score, batting average. Develop a program that will store information of 25 cricket players 
around the world using this structure. Also display names of these cricketers in descending order with 
respect to their batting average.
19. Write a program to swap two numbers using a function. Pass the values to be swapped to this function 
using call-by-value method and call-by-reference method.
20. Write a program to accept a set of 10 numbers and print the number using pointer
